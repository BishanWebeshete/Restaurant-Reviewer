# Retail-Rater

A web application for shoppers who want to rate and review retail stores.

This project was created using PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node along with Bootstrap with the intention of solidifying and expanding my knowledge on full stack web development. I wanted to create a web application where I could allow users to enjoy a dynamic rating system so that they could descriptively convey their opinions on various stores as well as see other users opinions.
